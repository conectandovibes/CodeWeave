TRACERT.EXE is a command-line utility in the Windows operating system, specifically version 10.0.15063.0, developed and published by Microsoft, which is used to trace the pathway that data packets take from one network node to another, typically from a user's computer to a specified destination on the internet. The tool provides insights into the route taken by packets, helping users diagnose network issues and determine where delays or failures may occur along the way. TRACERT.EXE is considered safe and is not associated with any virus or malware; it is a legitimate system file essential for network troubleshooting. However, users may encounter errors while using TRACERT.EXE, such as the inability to reach a destination due to network configuration issues, firewall settings, or problems with the remote server itself.
